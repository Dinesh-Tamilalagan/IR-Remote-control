# IR-Remote-control
Open-Lab Project
# Problem Statement
In many modern electronic applications, remote control plays a vital role in enabling wireless device operation. Traditional remote control systems typically depend on microcontrollers, which increases system complexity. To address these limitations, we developed a six-channel IR remote control system using only analog components, eliminating the need for microcontrollers. This approach simplifies the circuit design and offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative for basic remote-control applications.
