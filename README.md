# IR-Remote-control
Open-Lab Project
# Problem Statement
In many modern electronic applications, remote control plays a vital role in enabling wireless device operation. Traditional remote control systems typically depend on microcontrollers, which increases system complexity. To address these limitations, we developed a six-channel IR remote control system using only analog components, eliminating the need for microcontrollers. This approach simplifies the circuit design and offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative for basic remote-control applications.
# Objective
This project aims to design and implement a simple IR remote control system without a microcontroller. The system should be capable of transmitting multiple control signals using an IR transmitter and decoding them using an IR receiver. The system was integrated into PCBs for stability and performance.
